Below are some important notes:

1. Currently Unreal Engine 5 Early Access is NOT supported, please download the latest Unreal Engine 5 "Preview" Build from the Epic Marketplace. 

2. Always align your mesh to face positive X forward, otherwise the blueprints won't work correctly. 

3. If you duplicate a Wire BP actor (3rd tool) when it's connected to another mesh in the details panel, it MIGHT crash. Make sure to break the connection first, then duplicate it.

4. For the Deformation BP, make sure your mesh has lots of subdivisions along the X axis to be able to bend nicely. 

If you're having issues or something doesn't work as expected, please let me know by leaving a comment on the Youtube tutorial video and I will have a look at it!
